# ðŸ’» TopOS

Monolith `X86` operating system with `GRUB` bootloader.
Made for **fun** and **educational** purposes.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- GRUB bootloader
- Terminal output
- Serial port support
- Keyboard support
- Simple shell

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) â€” a command runner (alternative to `make`)
- `i686-elf-gcc`, `i686-elf-as`, `i686-elf-ld` â€” cross-compilation toolchain
  for i686 (you'll need to build it manually)
- `grub-mkrescue`, `xorriso` â€” to create a bootable ISO with GRUB
- `qemu-system-i386` - to run OS

## ðŸ›  Building & Run

### Build ISO

You can write ISO on your hard-drive and launch **TopOS** on real hardware!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suleiman0212/TopOS
cd topos/

just build
just iso
```

Or you can launch it under QEMU!

```bash
# Manually
just build
just iso
just run # qemu-system-i386 topos.iso

# Or one command

just one # clean, build, iso, run
```
